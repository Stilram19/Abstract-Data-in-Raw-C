# Abstract Data (In Raw C)

**Abstract Data** is a self-contained C library that implements common data structures inspired by the C++ STL (Standard Template Library), but using only raw C — no macros, no generic tricks, and no dependencies beyond the C standard library.

This project is built with a systems programming mindset and focuses on:
- memory safety
- API clarity
- encapsulation and modularity
- production-grade error handling

> goal: build a reusable, testable, and efficient container library that mimics the behavior of STL containers like `vector`, `list`, `deque`, `stack`, `priority_queue`, `map`, and `set` — all in portable C.

## 🔧 Features

- generic: every container accepts element size at construction time
- oop-inspired design: each module exposes a clean C interface (`.h`) and hides internal implementation details
- robust error handling: all public functions return status codes (`OK`, `ERR`) or NULL, no `assert()`s in release code
- memory safe: no leaks, no double frees, no uninitialized access
- test-driven: each container has its own unit and stress tests
